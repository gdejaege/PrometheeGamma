A built-in preference learning module available in the "Help for Parameters" tab.
This module implements an algorithm for determining value ranges for the 3 parameters specific to the PROMETHEE gamma method, based on a small number of peer comparisons to be evaluated by the user.
The maximum number of comparisons is 10 (or less if the number of available alternatives does not allow 10 different comparisons).
Comparisons are selected at random.
The user can choose to evaluate fewer than 10 comparisons, by clicking on the "confirm" button instead of the "next" button.
