The 3 PROMETHEE Î³ specific parameters are TI , TJ and Pf being respectively a global indifference threshold, a global incomparability threshold and a global preference factor. TI should be lower or equal to TJ.
You can modify the value of each of these 3 parameters either with the corresponding slider, or by writing the desired value directly.
Possible values range from 0 to 1 for TI and TJ, and from 1 to "infinity" for Pf.
