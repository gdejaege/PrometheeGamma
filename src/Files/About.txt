This application applies the PROMETHEE γ method, developed in the article by Gilles DEJAEGERE and Yves DE SMET: 
"Promethee γ: a new Promethee based method for partial ranking based on valued coalitions of monocriterion net flow scores" (https://doi.org/10.1002/mcda.1805). 
It displays the results in 3 different ways, as a matrix, as an orthogonal graph and as a ranking, 
while allowing the impact of the 3 parameters specific to the method to be visualized. 
The application also offers help in determining these 3 parameters, 
thanks to a small number of peer comparisons evaluated by the user.
